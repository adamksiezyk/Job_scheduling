# Job scheduling
The project was built for a company to optimize job scheduling.

This project was build to schedule jobs based on the resources given in an Excel spreadsheet.

The scheduling criteria are based on:
- machine availability
- machines amount
- workers availability
- workers amount
- shift durations
- project start and end date

The optimized variable is the total workflow duration.

The program uses multiprocessing and produces a scheduled output in Excel format and a chart.
To start the script install nececery packages and run Job_scheduling.py
