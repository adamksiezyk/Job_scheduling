# Job_scheduling
<i>The project was built for an external company. They determined the criteria.</i><br/><br/>
This project was build to schedule jobs based on the resources given in Excel.<br/>
The scheduling criteria are based on:<br/>
<ul>
  <li>machine availability</li>
  <li>machines amount</li>
  <li>workers availability</li>
  <li>workers amount</li>
  <li>shift durations</li>
  <li>project start and end date</li>
</ul><br/>
The program uses threadding/multiprocessing (depends on the version you use) and produces a scheduled output in Excel format and a chart.<br/>
To start the script install nececery packages and run Job_scheduling.py
